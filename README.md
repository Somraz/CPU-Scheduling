# CPU-Scheduling
CPU Scheduling Algorithms in Operating Systems
This project demonstrates the CPU Scheduling Algorithms in OS using Gantt Chart in Java
I have implemented following algorithms: 
1. FCFS (First Come First Serve)
2. Round Robin 
3. Preemptive SJF (Shortest Job First)
4. Non-Preemptive SJF (Shortest Job First)
5. Preemptive Priority
6. Non-Preemptive Priority
